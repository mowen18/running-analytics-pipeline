"""Activity-stream backfill: time-series samples for sample-grain analysis.

Resumable by construction: fetch eligibility (D15 revised v1.4 — a
data-availability gate, not a metric-eligibility gate) selects runs
with heart rate and >= STREAM_FETCH_MIN_MOVING_MINUTES that have no
streams row yet OR a 'failed' row — success and 'unavailable' (Strava
has no streams for the activity, which never changes after upload) are
terminal, so re-running converges instead of re-burning budget. Each
activity commits its own row, so an interruption loses at most the
in-flight fetch.

At most STREAM_MAX_ACTIVITIES_PER_RUN activities per invocation; the
last successfully processed activity is logged. Rate limits stop the
run cleanly between fetches (committed rows kept), mirroring Phase 1.

Counts and activity ids are logged; token values never are.
