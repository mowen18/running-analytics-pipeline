"""Weather ingestion: attach Open-Meteo hourly weather to outdoor runs.

raw_weather.hourly is both the destination and the cache: needed
location-hours are whatever eligible runs require minus what the table
already holds, so every sync is inherently incremental and the first one
is a natural backfill. There is no sync_state watermark; `full=True`
re-fetches even cached hours (the archive occasionally revises data).

Eligible runs are outdoor running activities: Run/TrailRun (VirtualRun is
indoor), non-empty start coordinates, trainer flag not set, on or after
the D5 historical floor. Indoor runs are excluded by design — they have
no location, and outdoor weather would be wrong for them anyway; they are
counted explicitly, never silently dropped.

Missing weather is recorded explicitly as rows with NULL measurements
(never zero). Requests pass no `models` parameter, so the archive's
`best_match` default stitches ERA5 (0.25 deg, ~5-day delay), ERA5-Land
(0.1 deg), and low-latency ECMWF IFS analysis (9 km) per hour: recent
dates arrive immediately as real preliminary IFS values, and nothing in
the response says which dataset served which hour (fetched_at relative
to the observation date is the only heuristic proxy). All-NULL rows
occur only when the archive genuinely has no data for an hour — the
rare case — and are re-requested by later syncs until data appears. A
cache-completeness check must know whether the source's answer was
final; ours treats any non-NULL value as final, so preliminary values
are frozen until a `full` re-fetch, whose IS DISTINCT FROM upsert
absorbs revisions. A failed batch never fails the sync: it is logged,
counted, and left for the next run. Coordinates are never logged beyond
the 2-dp cell key.
